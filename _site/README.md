# Adrienne H. Slaughter: Personal Github Site

I built this based on guidance from (Jonathan McGlone)[http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/], so while I 
make it personal you may see some references to things that aren't me (I'm not in *Touch of Evil*). 

### Current Tasks

- [ ] Add project info
- [ ] Create some structure to automatically (?) add projects to this site
- [ ] What's the simplest way to embed my Github activity calendar on the page?
