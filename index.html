<div class="blurb">
	<h1>Hi there, I'm Adrienne Slaughter!</h1>
	<P>
		I'm an engineer and design technologist passionate about making ubiquitous technology a reality, from mobile phones and wearable devices 
	to ambient technologies (Internet of Things), and the distributed systems that support them. Yes, I totally just pulled that from my resume. 
	</P>
	
<P>I'm just getting started using Github to show off some of my work, so it's looking a bit bare-bones around here. I have all these great ideas for 
	automatically populating stuff and, you know, all the crazy goodness that is Github Pages and Jekyll. 
</P>
		
<P>
	In the meantime, here are two projects to see a bit more of: 
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/ahope/iot_clock">An internet-connected, voice-controlled LED clock</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/ahope/fuzzy-octo-robot">Re-creating virtual air hockey on my dining room table.</a> (Don't get your 
			hopes up too high for this one yet-- I just got started, and it's all pretty messy. I still like the idea though!)</li>
	</ul>
	More projects (or descriptions) coming as I summarize or move stuff from various other repos. 
</p>
