Primarily teaching in the Align program, a fast-growing, intensive program designed to provide students without background in Computer Science the core competencies to join and complete Northeastern's traditional MS in Computer Science.

* Redesigned Align curriculum to align with Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) curricula recommendations and improve the learning experience for students.
* Designed, developed and launched two courses that became part of the permanent curriculum: Internet of Things, Security and Privacy of User Accounts.
* Mentored student projects, including master theses, projects with the Experiential Network (a unique initiative built to help all students engage in experiential learning opportunities with real-world partners), and collaborations with external researchers.
