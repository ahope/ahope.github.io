 The Northeastern Universityâ€”Seattle campus is home to multiple Master of Science (MS) programs. Primarily teaching in the Align program, a fast-growing, intensive program designed to provide students without background in Computer Science the core competencies to join and complete Northeastern's traditional MS in Computer Science.

* Redesigned Align curriculum to align with Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) curricula recommendations and improve the learning experience for students.
* Designed, developed and launched two courses that became part of the permanent curriculum: Internet of Things, Security and Privacy of User Accounts.
* Mentored student projects, including master theses, projects with the Experiential Network (a unique initiative built to help all students engage in experiential learning opportunities with real-world partners), and collaborations with external researchers.
* Provided research opportunities for under-represented Align students interested in pursuing a PhD so they could take advantage of Google research sponsorship. 
* Supervised \[lead instructor\] classes with largest enrollments (~90 students), multiple sections, instructors, and teaching assistants (12-15). 
* Recruited adjunct faculty to assist with fast growing classes. Facilitated new adjunct faculty to foster consistency in the curriculum and a sense of connection with the campus and university.
* Refined, strengthened and delivered analytics curriculum for the Level program (a data analytics bootcamp in the New Ventures program). 


**Classes taught:** Discrete Math, Introduction to Computer Systems, Introduction to Algorithms, Mobile Applications Design and Development, Internet of Things, Information Visualization. Security and Privacy of User Accounts, Professional Development Paradigms, Foundations of Software Development, Advanced Software Engineering.
