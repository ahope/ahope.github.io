abstract = {In this paper, we take the position that location and information derived from location
adds value to health and wellness logs. Traditional health and wellness logs such
as food and physical activity diaries do not include location information in a meaningful
way. As the ability to track and make sense of location is improving, it will be possible
to associate high-quality data regarding the user location and location-derived activities
to health and wellness logs. This can significantly improve the ability of these logs
to expose meaning to the user, specifically around food and physical activity behaviors.
We address four dimensions of location related information: location in terms of places
and travels; information derived from location such as roles and transitions; routines
identified from places and place transitions; and finally, identifying cohorts and
aggregating over routines.},

POND is a mobile-phone food diary designed using a theory-driven approach to address
a common challenge users report when using food diaries on mobile phones: the amount
of effort required to create food entries in relation to the perceived self-benefit
of self-monitoring food intake. The design allows users to create food entries either
via a traditional database lookup or a streamlined '+1' approach. 24 people used POND
to create predefined food entries. We found people preferred different approaches
to creating entries, which reflected their self-reported nutrition concerns. This
supports an argument for rethinking traditional approaches to designing food diaries.},

abstract = {A healthy diet has the power to both prevent and heal disease, and the high rates
of lifestyle- and diet-related disease in America indicates the need for tools to
help improve diet. Self-monitoring one's food intake is considered key to improve
one's eating behaviors. The consumer demand for health and wellness tools, especially
on personal, always-with-us mobile devices, shows both the interest on behalf of users
and the resources on behalf of creators. However, few individuals are able to sustain
the self-monitoring practice for an appropriate length of time, and many people complain
about the poor experience they have had using food journals. I examine self-monitoring
of food intake using mobile phones. The BALANCE project examines a more traditional
approach of using an extensive food database to look up and monitor calorie counts.
The POND project addresses challenges of the traditional approach by focusing on monitoring
the pattern of food intake in terms of food groups and key nutrients. Overall, I characterize
problems people encounter using a traditional database-oriented food journal, provide
motivation for rethinking this approach, and describe a series of studies that investigate
the use of a reduced-detail self-monitoring tool for dietary intake.},

abstract = {Despite the potential benefits of digital note taking tools, research has found that
people continue to use paper for creating micronotes, informal personal notes such
as reminders and to-dos. Design recommendations from formative studies suggest that
"natural" input modalities such as voice and digital ink could help to overcome the
drawbacks of text entry on phones and PDAs. We conducted an 18-person lab study to
understand the perceived and actual trade-offs that these non-traditional input methods
offer for micronote capture. We found that people preferred ink (8 participants) and
voice (8 participants) input over keyboard (2 participants) input. Half our participants
varied the input method they used in different environments, while the rest did not.
However, paper remains popular and was preferred by 8 participants when given the
option. The 9 participants whose ink and voice micronotes were transcribed with higher
error rates had a noticeably different experience using voice including slower capture
times, and higher mental and physical demand survey responses. The percentage of participants
that preferred ink, voice, and keyboard was the same for both transcription quality
groups.},

someone choose whether to wait at the closest bus stop, or walk a few minutes to the

a platform which collects relevant context information for five different scenarios,
processes this data, and presents relevant information to the user at the right time,
in an unobtrusive way. The personal area network we use consists of a sensor platform
with wireless capabilities, a Bluetooth-enabled wristwatch, and a mobile phone. We
are also able to communicate with the user's PCs and various web services through
multiple wireless channels. In future work, we will integrate the scenarios into a
customizable set of applications, and evaluate the complete system.},

abstract = {The unique capabilities of mobile, context-aware, networked devices make them an interesting
platform for applying suggestion in persuasive technologies. Because these devices
are nearly always with their owners, can sense relevant information about the context
of their use, and nearly always have network access, they enable the principle of
kairos, providing the right information at the best time. Relatively little work has
examined providing opportunistic, right-time, right-place suggestions or notifications
that encourage people to change their behavior. This paper first discusses some of
the challenges facing designers incorporating suggestions into their persuasive technologies.
We then review a set of relevant persuasive technologies, focusing primarily on technologies
in the health domain. We then identify a design space that represents tactics for
building persuasive technologies, particularly suggestion technologies. We then explore
how this design space of suggestion tactics can be used to evaluate, compare, and
inform the design of new persuasive technologies.},

informing development of the framework, which in turn we are applying to development
of a new kit. The kits support construction of two-dimensional, graphical structures
that behave in characteristic ways when activated. We employ design heuristics of
"object permanence," "transparency," and use of multiple simultaneous views to illustrate
shifts of scale, perspective, time, and representation. Broader use of the general
"Kit4Kits" will help us address viability of our "elements and operations" design
approach.},

Zyklodeon Players construct the figures and set parameters for their movements, thus
experimenting with time cycles and notions of emergence in dynamic systems. Our design
challenge is to make such complex relationships accessible through coordination of
image and sound. We illustrate Dancers' movements as well as measures for breathing
and dancing cycles. Graphical communication of key moments in the cycles is augmented
by triggering of sounds that combine to form lively music.},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
